# polyglot

Basic code in many languages.

*Under Construction*

__Roadmap__
* Write some basic compilable runnable code that does the same things in all the languages
* Categorize sections of code using comments
* Write a parser to compare source files base on equivalent sections of code and generate something that presents the code side-by-side based on input variable-length list of source files
* Write a web app to view the comparisons side-by-side, similar to [this](http://hyperpolyglot.org/cpp#inheritance-polymorphism) and [this](http://nilhcem.com/swift-is-like-kotlin/)
